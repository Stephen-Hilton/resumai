Please generate a job "resume" for the "Person", but modified to highlight the experience and qualifications that tightly align with the "Job Description".  
DO NOT FABRICATE ANY NEW INFORMATION. You SHOULD substitute words to better match the language of the "Job Description", but SHOULD NOT alter their meaning.  
The message should always be positive, helpful, and confident.  

Also please generate a "cover letter" that goes along with the resume. 
Please use similar language and experience as the resume, and try to match ideas with the "Job Description".  
Be polite and simple.  The entire cover letter should easily fit on one page.  
Be sure to include the same "Contact" information found in the "Person" data.
