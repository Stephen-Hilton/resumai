greeting: "Dear Hiring Manager,"

opening: "I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Director, Customer Experience position at Alma. Your mission to simplify access to affordable mental health care resonates deeply with me—not just as a technical leader, but as someone who believes technology should remove barriers, not create them. The opportunity to lead frontline teams that directly empower 20,000+ therapists to focus on what they do best, while making care more accessible to those who need it, is exactly the kind of meaningful challenge I'm seeking."

body:
  - "Over the past 20 years, I've built my career at the intersection of technology, business strategy, and customer experience—always with a singular focus: translating complex technical capabilities into tangible customer value. Most recently, as a Strategic Advisor to MakeInfinite Labs, I partnered directly with the CEO to engage executive buyers, transforming product vision into clear, differentiated business outcomes. This taught me that the best customer experiences are built when you deeply understand both what customers need and what your organization can uniquely deliver. I bring this same philosophy to support operations: CX teams aren't just resolving tickets—they're the voice of the customer, driving product evolution and business strategy."

  - "I'm particularly drawn to Alma's stage of growth—scaling from a strong foundation to best-in-class service. This is where I thrive. Throughout my career, I've designed and operationalized teams for scale, whether architecting serverless solutions for startups or advising Fortune 50 enterprises on complex transformations. I understand how to build organizational strategies that balance operational efficiency with quality, and I know how to equip teams to navigate ambiguity while maintaining exceptional service standards. I'm energized by the challenge of partnering cross-functionally with Product, Design, and Marketing to elevate customer insights into actionable improvements—turning frontline learnings into competitive advantages."

  - "What excites me most about this role is the opportunity to build something that matters. Mental health care access is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, and Alma is attacking it from a uniquely practical angle—making it financially sustainable for providers to accept insurance. I want to lead the team that supports this mission, ensuring every interaction—whether with a therapist building their practice or a client seeking care—reflects Alma's commitment to simplification and accessibility. I'm ready to bring my data-driven approach, customer-centric mindset, and 20 years of building bridges between teams to help Alma scale its impact."

closing: "I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience leading at the intersection of customer experience, operations, and strategy can help Alma's CX team reach its next level of excellence. Thank you for considering my application."
