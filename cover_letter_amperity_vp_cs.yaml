greeting: "Dear Amperity Hiring Team,"

opening: "I'm writing to express my strong interest in the VP, Customer Success position at Amperity. As someone who has spent two decades bridging the gap between cutting-edge technology and customer outcomes, I'm energized by Amperity's AI-first approach to solving one of the most critical challenges businesses face today: turning customer data into actionable insights that drive loyalty and growth."

body:
  - "What excites me most about this role is the opportunity to lead customer success at a company where AI isn't just a feature—it's fundamental to both the product and the culture. Throughout my career, I've been passionate about delivering creative yet practical solutions that achieve win-win outcomes: delighting customers while hitting ambitious revenue goals. At a stealth startup, I served as Fractional CTO and Principal Engineer, where I didn't just build technology—I designed and delivered the first production-grade proof-of-concept that evolved into a scalable AWS serverless architecture. This experience taught me that customer success begins with understanding their business problems first, then architecting solutions that deliver time-to-value quickly and sustainably."

  - "My experience as a Strategic Advisor at MakeInfinite Labs (formerly Space and Time Labs) directly aligns with Amperity's need for strategic customer relationship management. I partnered directly with the CEO on high-stakes customer, partner, and vendor engagements, translating complex product vision into clear, differentiated business value for executive buyers. This is exactly the mindset required to lead Customer Success Managers in developing strategic account plans that maximize long-term value and minimize churn. I understand that successful customer relationships at the enterprise level require speaking the language of business outcomes, not just technical capabilities—whether I'm presenting to DBAs or CTOs."

  - "I'm a strong believer in data-driven decision-making and AI enablement, which positions me uniquely to lead customer success for an AI-powered Customer Data Cloud. I know how to build high-performing teams, optimize onboarding frameworks for scalability, and collaborate cross-functionally with Product, Sales, and Support to create exceptional customer experiences. More importantly, I understand that customer success in the enterprise SaaS world isn't just about retention—it's about becoming a trusted strategic partner who helps customers unlock the full potential of their investment."

closing: "I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my technical depth, strategic advisory experience, and customer-centric leadership approach can help Amperity's customers realize maximum value from your platform while driving sustainable growth for the business. Thank you for considering my application."
