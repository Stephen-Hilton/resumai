greeting: "Dear Hiring Manager,"

opening: "I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Director, Client Success position at Affirm. With 20 years of experience bridging technology, business strategy, and customer success—including leadership roles scaling client relationships from Series A startups to Fortune 50 enterprises—I'm excited by the opportunity to drive merchant value and build a high-performing SMB Client Success organization at a company that's reinventing credit with honesty and innovation."

body:
  - "Throughout my career, I've built my reputation on delivering win-win outcomes that delight clients while achieving aggressive revenue goals. As a Strategic Advisor at MakeInfinite Labs, I partnered directly with the CEO on high-stakes customer and partner engagements, translating complex technical product vision into clear, differentiated business value for executive buyers. This experience taught me how to speak the language of diverse stakeholders—from technical teams to C-suite decision-makers—and to build relationships grounded in trust and mutual success. I bring this same approach to client success: deeply understanding merchant needs, translating them into actionable strategies, and advocating for the customer voice internally to drive product and operational improvements."

  - "What excites me most about this role is the opportunity to build scalable, data-driven engagement models that empower SMB merchants to grow with Affirm. I'm a strong believer in leveraging analytics to identify growth opportunities and optimize business outcomes. As an Advisor and Fractional CTO at a stealth startup, I designed and evolved a proof-of-concept into a production-grade AWS serverless architecture, making strategic platform tradeoffs to support both rapid MVP development and future scale. I apply this same systems-thinking approach to customer success operations—building playbooks, coverage models, and performance frameworks that create repeatable excellence while maintaining the flexibility to adapt as the business evolves. My technical background also enables me to partner effectively with Product and Engineering teams, ensuring the merchant perspective shapes roadmap decisions and drives meaningful innovation."

  - "Leading and developing high-performing teams is where I find the greatest fulfillment. I believe in fostering a culture of accountability, continuous learning, and operational rigor—coaching team members to think strategically, use data to tell compelling stories, and own both merchant outcomes and their own professional growth. I'm energized by the challenge of scaling an SMB Client Success organization across multiple verticals, optimizing for both merchant satisfaction and long-term profitability, and I'm confident that my cross-functional leadership experience and passion for customer-centric strategy make me the right person to drive this vision forward at Affirm."

closing: "Thank you for considering my application. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience scaling client success operations, building data-driven engagement strategies, and developing exceptional teams can contribute to Affirm's mission and growth. I look forward to speaking with you soon."
