greeting: "Dear 1Password Hiring Team,"

opening: "I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Director, Customer Success Management position at 1Password. As someone who has spent two decades building bridges between technology, business outcomes, and exceptional customer experiences, I'm energized by 1Password's mission to unleash employee productivity without compromising security. Your human-centric approach to cybersecurity and your position as one of the most loved brands in the industry resonates deeply with my own philosophy: the best solutions are those that delight customers while driving meaningful business results."

body:
  - "Throughout my career, I've operated at the intersection of technical depth and strategic customer engagement—exactly the dual focus this role requires. Whether advising Fortune 50 enterprises or guiding Series A startups through critical growth inflection points, I've consistently turned complex technical capabilities into clear, differentiated value that resonates with executive buyers. At MakeInfinite Labs, I partnered directly with the CEO on high-stakes customer, partner, and vendor engagements, translating product vision into compelling business outcomes. This experience has sharpened my ability to build relationships that transform customers into advocates—a cornerstone of the customer success strategy you're looking to scale."

  - "I'm particularly drawn to the challenge of designing and operationalizing a data-informed Customer Success strategy across SMB, Commercial, and Enterprise segments. In my role as Advisor and Fractional CTO for a stealth startup, I designed and delivered scalable architectures that evolved from proof-of-concept to production—demonstrating my commitment to building foundations that support rapid growth without sacrificing quality. I bring this same systems-thinking approach to customer success: creating frameworks, processes, and team structures that scale elegantly while maintaining the personalized touch that drives retention and expansion. My passion for data-driven decision-making and AI enablement aligns perfectly with 1Password's innovative edge and your need for a leader who can leverage insights to predict churn risks, identify growth opportunities, and optimize team performance."

  - "What excites me most about 1Password is the opportunity to join a GTM leadership team at a company that's not just growing rapidly—surpassing $400M in ARR—but doing so with a clear purpose and beloved brand. I thrive in fast-paced, dynamic environments where I can up-level teams, solve hard problems, and contribute to something larger than myself. The chance to help 180,000+ businesses, from Fortune 100 leaders to innovative AI companies, secure their digital future while building a world-class Customer Success organization is exactly the kind of challenge I'm seeking."

closing: "I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience leading at the intersection of customer experience and revenue growth can help 1Password continue its impressive trajectory. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your mission of building a safer, simpler digital future."
